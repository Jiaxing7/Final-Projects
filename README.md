### Overview
Nowadays, reading is an indispensable part of our daily life. We also often look for books to read online, and the first thing we do is check the various lists.
Goodreads is the largest English-language website for book reviews by non-professional readers in America.As of 2019, Goodreads has 90 million users.

In this project, I used web scraping to get the Best Books Ever List for analysis and compare it with the Best Books Ever List of 2018.
Finally, I made a book recommendation. 

### Steps
1. Get data with web scraping
2. Data Wrangling and Cleaning 
3. Visualization and Analysis
4. Build Regression model
5. Book recommendation

### What I used
#### 1.Regression model:
* train_test_split

* DecisionTreeRegressor
* RandomForestRegressor
* P-Value
#### 2.Book recommendation
